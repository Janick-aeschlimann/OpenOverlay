# OpenOverlay

**OpenOverlay** is a powerful open-source web application for creating and managing customizable overlays, primarily designed for live streams and live productions.

The key feature is **real-time collaboration**: multiple users can edit the same overlay simultaneously in the browser and instantly see each other’s changes. All updates made in the editor are automatically reflected live in the overlay, ensuring smooth and immediate control during a broadcast.

Streamers and teams can quickly respond to live events — for example, launching polls, temporarily hiding sensitive or unwanted content, adding fun or informative graphics, or toggling visibility of donation alerts — all with just a few clicks.

OpenOverlay is fully **open-source** and can be **self-hosted**, giving you complete freedom and control over your streaming setup.
